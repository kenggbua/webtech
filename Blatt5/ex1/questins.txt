What is event bubbling and event capturing?
When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it,
then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.


Capturing phase – the event goes down to the element.
Target phase – the event reached the target element.
Bubbling phase – the event bubbles up from the element.


How can you specify what method to use?
default is bubbling
capture : true
elem.addEventListener(..., true)




How can you stop the propagation of events?
event.stopPropagation()
event.stopImmediatePropagation()
If an element has multiple event handlers on a single event,
then even if one of them stops the bubbling, the other ones still execute.



What is the difference between this, event.target and event.currentTarget?
event.target – is the “target” element that initiated the event, it doesn’t change through the bubbling process.
this(= event.currentTarget) – is the “current” element, the one that has a currently running handler on it.


What happens if parent elements have event handlers attached?
if the propagataion is not stopped their handler will trigger aswell



What happens if parent and child elements have event handlers attached?
